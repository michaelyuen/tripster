### `npm build` ðŸ¤–

- Removes `/dist`
- Builds Apollo Server as a Netlify Function to `/dist/lambda`

## Netlify Notes ðŸ““

- Typically the root of the Apollo Server would be `src/index.js`, but here it is `src/lambda/graphql.js`.
  - This is due to supporting Netlify Functions (with [netlify-lambda](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda)), where it looks to a source folder (`/src/lambda`) and outputs to a build folder (`/dist/lambda`).
  - When thinking of the root, just look to `src/lambda/graphql.js` and all else should be the same.
- Additionally, there's a custom webpack config (`webpack.lambda.js`) to be aware of. Reference the comment at the top of the file for more info.
- [`netlify.toml`](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/) does what it do
  - In this specific case, I don't think the `base` portion does anything but I think it's good to keep it regardless.
  - I believe this is due to our monorepo structure, because I had to define the base directory in the Netlify UI for the Deploy to work correctly. After that, it picked up the rest from the config file.
- Env variables are defined in the Netlify UI, copied from local values.
